# ZR SkinID Finder

Python script that allows you to get a SkinID from a skin name.

### Usage
* First run **update.py** to get all the skin data from the ZR API. It will create a new file called **items.json**
* Run **find.py** and insert whatever skin you want. There are a couple rules tho.
* Run **update.py** everytime the game updates to make sure all new cosmetics are compatible with my scripts.

### Formatting
For the find.py script to work you need to insert the name of the skin you wish to find an ID for. Doesn't matter if it's in upper or lower case.
The only thing that does matter is the spacing! If the skin has a space between words, ex. `Forest Elder`, you need to put that space there.
Similarly, if it does not have a space, ex. `Noobhammer`, you don't put it there. That easy.
